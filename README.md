# backend-tech-assessment

Instructions for running the code:

From this root directory, execute: mvn clean package
This will compile and package the application, and execute the unit tests.
Each of the 5 unit tests is meant to exercise one of the primary requirements for the
exercise. The code also runs with: mvn spring-boot:run (look for it on localhost:4000)

·        Exercise Difficulty: Easy, Moderate, Difficult, Very Difficult
 - I felt the exercise was moderate

·        How did you feel about the exercise itself? (1 lowest, 10 highest—awesome way to assess coding ability)
 - 10, it was fun!

·        How do you feel about coding an exercise as a step in the interview process?  (1 lowest, 10 highest—awesome way to assess coding ability)
 - 10, all (software) employers should require it

·        What would you change in the exercise and/or process?
 - I wouldn't change a thing. It was just right

I spent approx 8 hours on the project, not including setup time.
